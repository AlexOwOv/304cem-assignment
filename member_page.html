		 The main story of this work is a description of the two politically opposed organizations in the war, 
		 accidentally but proactively becoming the protagonist of the military robot driver, and his companions, 
		 in the war, desperately to survive the group drama. In terms of supporting roles, the people who support 
		 the protagonists and the soldiers of the Principality of the Principality who are opposite to the protagonist 
		 also have many characters with rich personalities. The meticulous description of the roles of the two works makes 
		 the world content of the works very rich, and also produces many famous scenes and stories with deep thoughts. 
		 The most breakthrough in this work is the traditional model of the mechanical hero animation "Good Man V.S. Bad Guy", 
		 creating a more realistic and closer to real life role, making it closer to drama. Many of the "decent" characters, 
		 including the protagonist, have their own shortcomings and insurmountable difficulties. 
		 Each person's experience also affects future life to varying degrees. 
		 For example, Lara's accidental death has left a huge shadow in Amro's heart, and it can't be erased in his life. 
		 In space. The so-called "reverse" characters have different reasons for their confrontation with "decent". 
		 Even the entire Pyongyang Principality was originally a group of cosmic colonies that were eager for peace, freedom, and equality. 
		 They were only taken away by the ambitions in the struggle, and gradually evolved into confrontation with the Earth. 
		 Their troops are actually Pu barrel people, for example, describe the army's rescue behavior to the civilians on Earth. 
		 Similar things are happening in the real world. This kind of story setting changes people's impressions that the cartoon content is simple and only suitable for children, 
		 making this work a classic after the beginning.

		As fossil fuels on the planet are depleted, humans are beginning to rely on solar power for new energy. 
		In 2307, a large solar power satellite was built with three orbital lifts of about 50,000 kilometers in length, 
		but only those countries that can use this system can participate in the construction of the alliance.
		In order to build these orbital lifts that produce semi-permanent energy, 
		the regions of the world have been integrated to form three super-large groups of countries. 
		They are the United States-centered United Nations Economic Union (UNION); the "Human Innovation Alliance" (China Leather Federation) centered on China, 
		Russia and India; and the "New European Community" (AEU) in Europe. Due to the large size of the orbital elevators, 
		it is difficult to defend and the structure is extremely fragile. Under this tension, 
		the three major groups of countries gradually expand the zero-sum game between them for their prestige and prosperity.
		In this world that cannot end the dispute, Celestial Being, a private armed group with a super-standard performance Mobile Suit "steel bomb", 
		appeared. In order to eradicate the war, they carried out armed forces that transcended nationality, state, and religion.
		As a result, the involvement of steel bombs in the conduct of the entire war began.

		In the 15th year of the Cosmic Era (CE), the world-famous talented young scientist George Glenn publicly announced that he was the adjuster born through genetic modification and became the first public adjuster in history (Coordinator). ). While revealing his secrets, he also publicized the methods of transforming human genes, and greatly increased the population of the world's regulators.

		At the same time, although countries have begun to regulate and regulate human genetic modification, they have not been able to prevent people from pursuing their own offspring genes and making their offspring more capable. At the same time as the population of the adjusters continues to increase, it has caused some ordinary humans who have not undergone genetic engineering, and the so-called "natural" to begin to embarrass and hate the adjusters. In the case of constant exclusion and threat from natural persons, the adjusters forced them to leave the Earth. In the colony satellite group of the L5 universe in CE44, they established the space colony PLANT, and at the same time organized the political and military autonomous organization, the Free Treaty Zodiac Alliance. (referred to as ZAFT, Zafft). Later, as George Glenn was murdered by natural persons in C.E.53, the influence of the Siegel Klein faction on the rise of the highest parliament of P.L.A.N.T., the relationship between the earth and the cosmic colonies gradually deteriorated. In the meantime, this protagonist, Huang Dahe, was born in C.E.55 (the only finished product of Dr. You Lian's super-adjuster R&D program).

		On February 5, C.E., the colonial and governing state talks held in the moon city of Copernicus were bombed by terrorist bombings (Copernico tragedy), and representatives of the Earth Council and the United Nations Secretary-General of the UN Secretary-General died. Subsequently, on February 7, the Atlantic Federation, one of the governing countries, issued the Alaska Declaration, claiming that the terrorist attack was carried out by P.L.A.N.T. and that the attack was a declaration of war against the earth and natural persons. The Atlantic Federation also announced the establishment of the Earth Federation to replace the United Nations that was paralyzed by the death of all the leaders. On February 11, the Earth Alliance Army declared war on P.L.A.N.T. Aggressive attacks began from the Ptolemy base on the moon. In addition, an officer belonging to the radical anti-adjuster organization Blue Universe ordered a nuclear bomb to be secretly transported into the MA space carrier Roosevelt. Although PLANT dispatched the MS forces to annihilate the enemy, due to a sudden nuclear bomb attack, one of the 120 PLANT space colonies, the agricultural satellite "Unyus-7" was devastated, resulting in 240,372. The death of a person, known as "Blood Valentine's Day", is also the starting point of this war.

		Due to the tragedy of "Bloody Valentine's Day", the dispute between the Earth and P.L.A.N.T. was escalated into a formal armed conflict. Eleven months after the war, the owner of the neutral state of the country, Kira Yamato, owned the colonial satellite "Heliopolis", which was greeted by childhood friend Athrun Zala. The ZAFT attack, their reunion became the beginning of the story.

		P.L.A.N.T. launched the War of Independence after the bloody Valentine's Day. The strategy of its military organization Z.A.F.T. was to spread a large number of "neutron jammers" to the ground, making nuclear energy inaccessible to most parts of the world, triggering a worldwide energy crisis. Gradually attacking the mass projector near the equator with new weapons, in order to block the Earth Alliance Army in the Earth Circle, and no longer threaten PLANT; it is named "Operation Ouroboros" because it looks like a big snake in mythology. Combat. At the beginning of the war, no one had doubted that the Earth Army would end the war quickly with overwhelming force and resources. However, the war has been glued for nearly a year, but the battle situation is increasingly unfavorable to the coalition forces. One of the main reasons is that the Earth Army is unable to do anything against Z.A.F.T.'s new weapon, the Mobile Suit (MS).

		In order to save the battle, the Atlantic Federation, the most powerful member of the Earth Union, has already developed a mobile warrior codenamed "G-Weapon" and secretly entrusted OP's state-owned military enterprise "Twilight Society" to assist in the construction of Heliopolis. Z.A.F.T.'s Kruze team grasped this information, dispatched a special unit to attack Heliopolis, and seized four of the "G weapons" five machines that were undergoing factory operations. Unexpectedly involved in this battle, the high-tech student of the Industrial University, Dahe, actually encountered Aslan Sarah, a childhood friend of Z.A.F.T. On a chaotic street, Huang accidentally took the only remaining GAT-X105 Strike. Looking at the full name of the G weapon system on the cockpit display, Huang unconsciously blurted out: "GUN...DAM...!".
